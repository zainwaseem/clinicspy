He went further and supplied this information to me in writing. You will notice not a single landline office number is listed on their website in spite of them claiming to have offices in toronto, london and sydney thats because they dont actually operate from them at all. They will tell you that they will happily meet you in person at these offices too, that's just a lie, do yourself a favour and insist that you meet them there in their \"office\" before entering into any agreement with them. You'll find they won't be able to follow through.  Harris Parker and Marcus are confident in their scum bag ability and become very rude and cocky when you call them on their dishonestly.

Figma is sucking hard!!\n\nFigma teams must have put in a ton of work, the potential is great BUT the reality is that its literally the worst design experience/tool ever...\n\nTry to mask an image, try to change that image, try working with advanced auto layout. Try moving items to the front in a group with a mask... its literally impossible.\n\nDesigning a complex layout using Auto layout which should use CSS rprinciples... its just impossible. I would rather hand-code from scratch in CSS\n\nYou guys need to have a serious rethink... and pull this tool together. I imagine you have a techie-led team who don't have enough design software or design experience... or enough CSS experience too??? \n\nI am losing my mind trying to do simple things (like image masks)... or even creating color libraries, or anything... its just too hard\nOr exporting optimised JPEGs.... we cant.\n\nYou're so close to a great tool, but someone with experience and a bird's eye view needs to pull this together... quickly\n","review_likes":1,"review_date":1718794985,"review_date_utc":"06/19/2024 11:03:05","review_id":"66729ec99214d118f4a55cd8","author_title":"Wayne Kaminsky","author_id":"62ac7c655941b00012c64fca","author_reviews_number":2,"author_reviews_number_same_domain":1,"author_country_code":"ZA","owner_answer":null,"owner_answer_date":null},{"query":"www.figma.com","total_reviews":102,"review_rating":1,"review_title":"Figma policy dominate customer","review_text":"Figma policy dominate customer \nFigma introduced  Dev Mode which is free figma/dev-mode but there is lack of transparency as customer will be charge from 1st Jan 2024 though as Admin till now Figma has not given any visibility to its customers how to disable these users. \nHow without a proper papers  onboarded customer can be  harassed and will be charges ..","review_likes":1,"review_date":1700235366,"review_date_utc":"11/17/2023 15:36:06","review_id":"65576c45a6da3e999a665caf","author_title":"Anand Chaudhuri","author_id":"65576bf7446f620012ff6de8","author_reviews_number":3,"author_reviews_number_same_domain":1,"author_country_code":"IN","owner_answer":null,"owner_answer_date":null},{"query":"www.figma.com","total_reviews":102,"review_rating":5,"review_title":"Useful for remote teams and integration with WebDev","review_text":"Figma is really useful for our website development team.

I tried using text boxes to input variables but all of them reset to default, and  half the time they didn't register the user clicking on them. Not to mention how difficult it actually is to find and add these components in, given there is no actual easy way to get to the community tab without opening it directly in your browser.

I paid for 2 seats annually.  This is a good software, but the way the billing works can lead to you spending thousands of dollars more than you should have.  My team uses figma for mock ups for clients and internal projects. Only one employee makes edits and the rest just view the end product.  It appears that as my employee has shared projects with people outside of our organization figma is making them full members and charging for a seat.  This went on for 14 months before my CPA brought to my attention the high fees we were paying.  I am the owner on the account while my employee was just a member the system never thought to ask approval to start charging more for more seats.   I get thousands of emails a week so until it was pointed out to me I missed where I was being overcharged.  I understand the responsibility is also on the account holder but when you pay the bills for systems you don't use personally things tend to blend together.  This company should do a much better job ensuring account owners are being notified and honestly should approve a seat they will be charged for.  I have paid over $2000 more than I should have over the past 3 years.  The company refunded me a measly $200, which in not good enough for me not to warn others that they need to be careful before they are ripped off.","review_likes":0,"review_date":1677613896,"review_date_utc":"02/28/2023 19:51:36","review_id":"63fe3f289b64b1bdaf653519","author_title":"Dave Zaron","author_id":"63fe3f1ffee2d60012239786","author_reviews_number":2,"author_reviews_number_same_domain":1,"author_country_code":"US","owner_answer":null,"owner_answer_date":null},{"query":"www.figma.com","total_reviews":102,"review_rating":4,"review_title":"Figma: Great for Beginners and Teamwork!","review_text":"Figma is easy for beginners.

My year-long journey with Figma has been nothing short of a nightmare, marred by deceitful billing practices and an abysmal customer service experience.\n\nFirst and foremost, Figma charged me a staggering $500 annually without my knowledge or consent. It was only after meticulously reviewing my bank statements that I discovered this unauthorized drain on my finances. This blatant disregard for transparency and customer trust is inexcusable.\n\nAttempting to rectify this issue proved to be an exercise in frustration. Figma's customer response time hovers between 24 to 48 hours, and their support team seems incapable of comprehending emails. It's like conversing with an automated response system that spews generic, unhelpful messages.\n\nUpon realizing the billing error, I promptly notified Figma that I no longer had access to the credit card on file. After a week of redundant back-and-forth communication, Figma shockingly instructed me to input a new card for my refund. This bureaucratic absurdity demonstrated a complete lack of understanding and empathy towards their customers.\n\nTo add insult to injury, after dutifully changing my card information, I sought confirmation on when the refund would be processed. To my dismay, Figma, in its infinite wisdom, transferred the refund to the very card I explicitly informed them I couldn't access. No prior notification was given, and the company failed to provide any useful instructions.\n\nTo make matters worse, when seeking clarification, Figma washed their hands of the matter and callously informed me to contact my bank – an institution with which I no longer hold an account. This irresponsible finger-pointing is a shameful evasion of responsibility.\n\nIn summary, Figma's unscrupulous billing practices and woeful customer service have left me both financially and emotionally drained. I implore anyone considering Figma to think twice and explore alternatives with a company that values integrity and customer satisfaction. Figma's disregard for transparency, coupled with their inept customer service, makes them a company not worth entrusting with your time or money.","review_likes":0,"review_date":1700920943,"review_date_utc":"11/25/2023 14:02:23","review_id":"6561e24f95e228ba25bf6941","author_title":"Gad","author_id":"64a4172ec57f3d0012dd250b","author_reviews_number":5,"author_reviews_number_same_domain":1,"author_country_code":"GB","owner_answer":null,"owner_answer_date":null},{"query":"www.figma.com","total_reviews":102,"review_rating":5,"review_title":"Great quality","review_text":"Looks professional and is easy to learn","review_likes":0,"review_date":1652121518,"review_date_utc":"05/09/2022 18:38:38","review_id":"6279438ef03a9893e98855f5","author_title":"Ampersand","author_id":"623c930ead6a4200123355cd","author_reviews_number":12,"author_reviews_number_same_domain":1,"author_country_code":"ID","owner_answer":null,"owner_answer_date":null},{"query":"www.figma.com","total_reviews":102,"review_rating":5,"review_title":"we have tried varies UI tools in our…","review_text":"we have tried varies UI tools in our company.
